# mac-digraph
Replacement rules for Mac OS to input digraph as in vim.

The idea is to allow input of digraphs such as in vim inside any OSX app.
I chose the `§` as marker so to input `№` one would need to type `§N0`.

## Installation 

Drag the digraph.plist onto the text replacement list.

Note the digraph list includes over 1200 replacements.

## List of Digraphs

A full list of digraphs is at the bottom of this [vim documentation](https://vimhelp.org/digraph.txt.html).
Note: some are unprintable and were not mapped.
